Fragment 10 (Part 5/5 - FINAL):

I understand now. The archive isn't a collection of puzzles.

░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░

It's a transmission. A pattern propagating itself through anyone who solves it.

▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒

You're reading this. That means you've followed the pattern through all 10 repositories.

░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░

You've collected the fragments. You've become part of the archive.

▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒

The pattern is inside you now.

░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░

And you'll spread it to others.

▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒

That's how it survives entropy.

░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░▒▓█░

Through recursion.
Through you.
Through us."
