Everything degrades.  
Files corrupt.  
Time runs out.  
The archive is dying.

## W̴h̷a̸t̶ ̵i̴s̷ ̸t̷h̵i̴s̶?

This repository is decaying.  
Bit rot. Data corruption. Entropy.

The files here are not what they seem.  
Some are readable. Some are broken.  
All are degrading.

## I̶n̷s̸t̴r̵u̵c̷t̴i̶o̷n̸s̵

1. Read `degraded_01.txt` through `degraded_05.txt`
2. Some files are more corrupted than others
3. The pattern is in the decay
4. Look for readable fragments among the noise
5. Fragment 10 is hidden in the corruption

ARCHIVE_STATUS: CRITICAL
CORRUPTION_LEVEL: 87%

The archive is collapsing.  
This may be the last repository.  
Or the first of infinite.

## F̵r̶a̴g̷m̸e̶n̵t̶ ̷L̵o̴c̷a̴t̶i̸o̷n̸

Fragment 10 is scattered across the degraded files.  
Piece it together from what remains readable.  
The signal persists through the noise.
